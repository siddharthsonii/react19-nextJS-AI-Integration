// Custom Hooks
// All hooks files are created with the .js extension, not .jsx, to avoid confusion with components. This is a common convention in the React community.

// In this file, we will create a custom hook called useCart that will manage the state of our shopping cart. This hook will provide functions to add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and clear the cart. It will also provide the current state of the cart, including the items in the cart and the total price.
